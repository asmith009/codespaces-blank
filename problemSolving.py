# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR GAME APP
# You are working on a game concept with several 
# other engineers and you need to provide them with a
#  simple proof of concepts. 
# For now, you have suggested that your 
# game work on a RPS (rock, paper, scissors) loop. 
# When a user plays, rock, paper, or scissors, 
# the computer will randomly select one of the 3 
# options as well. Your program will then determine 
# who won, based on the values. The game should only 
# allow the player to play 3 hands, and inform the 
# player if the won or lost (best 2 out of 3 format.) 

#  1. What is the problem asking you to do?
# The problem is asking to make a function using a list to randomly select from by the user and the computer to decipher who won or lost.
# 2. What are some keywords and phrases ? 
# Some key words and phrases are, loop, rock, paper, and scissors, randomly select out of three options, and to determine who won based on their values.
# 3. Is there input data that the question provides ?
# There will be 2 or more input datas in this function due to this game running for 3 rounds, and determining who won by the second.
# 4. What is the desired output ?
# The desired output is which of the randomly selected options won between the user and the computer, plus the ammount of rounds.
# 5. Pseudocode Steps & Additional Notes 
# we will need to make a list for the user and the computer to choose from.
# we will also have to use greater than or less than to verify the values of each choise.
# Then we will need to make a loop occurung 2 or more times.
# Then allow the function to decide who won.
