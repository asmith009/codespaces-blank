#Boys Latin has hired you to develop a grade checker program for students. 
#Your program should be able to do the following; allow a student to enter a numerical grade, 
#then return the appropriate letter grade. For example; if a student enters the number 80, the program should give back the letter grade "B". 
#Your program should then repeat by asking the user to enter another numerical grade. 
#Each time a user enters another numerical grade, it should perform some calculation to average out the grades and show the new letter grade, 
#For example: if the user enters the number 70, and the 100, they're average should be an 85, which is a B.

#1. In a complete sentence, what is the problem asking you to do ?
#The problem is asking for me to make a program that allows a stusent to inpoout their grade numerous times, then give the average grade.

#2. Were there any parts of the question that don't make sense, if so write them down in complete sentences.
# This part of the promt doesnt necessarily make sense, though im un able to understand how I would print the average grade.

#3. Please write down the keywords and phrases that will help you solve this problem ?
#   1. enter a number.    2. repeat.    3. average.    4. calculations.    5. return appropiate lette grade(output).

#4. Does the problem provide you with any input data? Does it tell you what type of data your program needs to take in ?
# The program is asking the user to inoput a number numerous times, in which the program will calculate the average amongst those grade.

#5. Does the problem provide you with desired output data? Does it tell you that your program needs to give somthing back to the user ?
# The proogram will produce the avergage letter grade.

#6. Using Pseudocode (fake code), write down Step by step how you think you can solve this problem. Remember, this does not have to be code.
# first i would give the program a name.
# then i would insert various inputs, for the user to input their grade.
# then i would use arithmatic coding for the computer to read, so it gives the avergae letter grade.
